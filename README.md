# Group 12 CS 4371 Project

## Summary

This project is an extension of the research paper "Evaluating Shallow and Deep Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection Systems in Cyber Security" [1]. It uses [Insert Alogrithms here] to train a model of an intrusion detection system against various types of threats.

## How to Run

The code for the project is contained within the 'G12.ipynb' notebook. Since the program requires the use of a TPU, it can be run using Google Colab.

## Data

The data that was used to train the model can be found under the [insert repo here]
